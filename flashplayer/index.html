<h1>Flash Player</h1>
<br>
<p>Because Flash will be discontinued and removed from Adobe's download page in the beginning of 2021, I have archived the most recent (and final) Flash Player.</p>
<p>In addition to this, I have archived the debug player for those of you who want to play local swf files.</p>
<p>Another cool thing I did was I created a Linux installer package for the Player. Originally, Adobe just provided the player that required you to do File > Open to play an swf. My installer makes the player into an application so you can set it as default. You can download that <a href="/flashplayer/library/debug/linux/debug/flashplayer.deb" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I know that some of you reading this are probably screaming, "THIS IS SUCH A SCAM HE WANTS TO GIVE US VIRUSES!!!!!". I assure you, that is not the case. I just want to redistribute an amazing piece of software. If you don't want to download this, that's your choice.</p>
<br>
<p><b>UPDATE: I just realized the installers get their files from Adobe's servers. Unfortunately, that means you can't install Flash Player anymore.</b></p>
<br>
<p>Something cool I found is <a href="https://www.palemoon.org/" target="_blank">Palemoon Browser</a>. It still supports Flash Player so if you want to view websites with Flash content, you could use it.</p>
